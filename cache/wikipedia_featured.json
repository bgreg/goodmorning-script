Initially, it contained stories only from Canadian authors, with much of its contents supplied by Thomas P. Kelley. Within a few issues, Colby began to obtain reprint rights to American stories from Donald A. Wollheim and Sam Moskowitz. Wollheim's and Moskowitz's later accounts of the relationship with Colby differ.

The wars originated in political forces arising from the French Revolution (1789–1799) and from the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802) and produced a period of French domination over Continental Europe. The wars are categorised as seven conflicts, five named after the coalitions that fought Napoleon, plus two named for their respective theatres: the War of the Third Coalition, War of the Fourth Coalition, War of the Fifth Coalition, War of the Sixth Coalition, War of the Seventh Coalition, the Peninsular War, and the French invasion of Russia.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Napoleonic Wars"},{"type":"standard","title":"Bay_of_Bengal","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bay of Bengal</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q38684","titles":{"canonical":"Bay_of_Bengal","normalized":"Bay of Bengal","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bay of Bengal</span>"},"pageid":47892,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Bay_of_Bengal_map.png/330px-Bay_of_Bengal_map.png","width":320,"height":326},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Bay_of_Bengal_map.png","width":1000,"height":1019},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1322476452","tid":"ce6cf9b6-c2e6-11f0-8bdb-bf5db8ac35e3","timestamp":"2025-11-16T12:21:41Z","description":"Northeastern part of the Indian Ocean","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":15,"lon":88},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bay_of_Bengal"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Bay_of_Bengal","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bay_of_Bengal"}},"extract":"The Bay of Bengal forms the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean, located between the Indian subcontinent and the Indochinese peninsula, south of the Bengal region.
